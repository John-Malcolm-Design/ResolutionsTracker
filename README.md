ResolutionsTracker
==================

Windows Phone 8.1 / Visual Studio 2013

An app that allows you to make and keep track of your new years resolutions.
You can add a resolution with a name and description and then each day launch the app and hit "I did this today".
A progress bar shows the progress for each resolution by counting the amount times you have hit "I did this today".

This app uses JSON to save data to disk and uses the MVVM model to seperate concerns within the app code.

This App is currenly under development - future commits will include:
- Better error handling.
- Additional images/icons for different screen resolutions.
- Instructions on how to use app when app is first loaded.
- Pages for each resolution that the user can add helpfull resources to.
